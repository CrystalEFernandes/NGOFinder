# NGOFinder

# Motivation
The motivation for the NGO finder app is to address the existing problems related to volunteering, such as the tedious task of finding suitable NGOs or volunteers, gathering a group of people for a certain volunteering task, and determining the trustworthiness of certain charities. The app aims to provide a smooth and effortless experience for users by creating an attractive user interface and using a Tinder-like interface to match volunteers and organizations. By bringing together NGOs, volunteers, and donors, the app seeks to promote coordination and eliminate hurdles in doing good deeds. Ultimately, the goal of the app is to encourage more people to get involved in charitable causes and make a positive impact in their communities.

# Goals and Objectives
• Profile Matching: This application will make applying for volunteering opportunities easier by using a swipe technique. The user will be able to save, view and apply for an opportunity by a mere action of a swipe.

• Donation-payment portal:The donation-payment portal will allow donors to make monetary contributions to various NGOs through a secure payment gateway using RazorPay.

• Recommend NGOs near me by location:This feature will use the user's location to recommend nearby NGOs. The app will use GPS to detect the user's location and then show the list of NGOs that operate in that area.

• A place for volunteers to communicate with each other, share their experiences or ideas:The app will provide a platform for volunteers to communicate with each other, share their
experiences, ideas, and tips. This feature will encourage volunteers to connect and share their knowledge and experiences with each other.

• Create awareness between like-minded volunteers about volunteer opportunities.

• Create a platform for seamlessly maintaining your volunteer profile.

• Creating an easy-to-use application that will eliminate the hassle of finding the right opportunity for you.

• Profile management: This application will provide a one stop shop for all volunteer opportunities. This requires an option to build and maintain a volunteer/ NGO profile.

• List view with filtering: We intend to provide seamless sorting of NGOs and candidates with a list that is easy to use and filter according to your preferences, like location, cause
etc.
